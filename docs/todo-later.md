# Low Level Lab — todo later

The single list of open work. Nothing here is scheduled.

`docs/plan.md` is what we decided to build. This file is what we decided to
build *eventually*. An item leaves this file only by moving into `plan.md` with
a decision row behind it.

Last updated 2026-11-09: `docs/arrakis/TODO.md` was merged in as Part 2, so one
file holds the open work.

**Two number series, on purpose.** `T<n>` is the site and the engine. `A<n>` is
arrakis, the machine, and `AB<n>` is an arrakis blocker. The arrakis file used
`T1`–`T26` and this one used `T1`–`T12` for different work, so the arrakis items
were renumbered on merge. A reference to `D<n>` or `Q<n>` points at
`docs/arrakis/learning.md` and was not changed.

---

# Part 1. The site and the engine

### 1. The site itself

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Customise the sign-in page | Today it is the stock WorkOS AuthKit screen. Needs the project's own name, wording and colours. Check what AuthKit lets us brand before deciding between theming it and self-hosting the form. |
| T2 | Sponsorship | Not designed. Open questions: who is being asked, what they get, and where it appears on the site without turning the question pages into advertising space. |
| T3 | Say on the site what remote execution will and will not be | Must be visible before anyone depends on it, not after. **This item is written from a half-caught sentence and needs confirming**: the intent was either "remote execution support will be dropped" or "a notice that it may be dropped". Do not build from it until it is settled. |

### 2. Running code

The large piece. It will take time, and that is accepted.

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T4 | A code execution engine | Build one or adopt a well-maintained one. Prefer adopting: a sandbox that runs other people's C++ is a security project, not a feature. Decide by reading what exists first. |
| T5 | Deploy it on arrakis | The engine does not run on Workers. arrakis is the machine it lands on. |
| T6 | Local running with near-zero config | The default path. A reader clones nothing and installs nothing beyond a compiler, and the question page tells them the one command. Friction here is the thing that decides whether anyone actually practises. |
| T7 | Remote running as the second path | For a reader with no toolchain. T6 must work without it; T7 must never become the only way to answer a question. |

### 3. Repositories

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~T8~~ | ~~Archive `~/Github/arrakis` and `~/Github/quarantine`~~ | **PORTED 2026-11-09.** Both repos are now in this one: engine → `apps/engine`, machine config → `arrakis/`, prose → `docs/arrakis/`. The ported k8s manifests were removed the same day (D72). The site moved to `apps/web` and this became a pnpm workspace. **The archiving itself is not done** — it is a `gh repo archive` the agent does not run. Four paths were deliberately *not* ported, see T12. |
| T12 | Rotate the secrets arrakis committed, then archive | `tofu/k8s/terraform.tfstate` is tracked in arrakis and holds a plaintext `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and Grafana `admin-password` (`random_password` results, written to state). `.terraform.tfstate.backup` holds the previous generation, and 81 MB of provider binaries are tracked beside them. Cause: `.gitignore` anchored `tofu/*.tfstate`, which never matched `tofu/k8s/`. Archiving does not remove them — a read of the archived repo still shows them. Rotate the passwords, then decide whether the repo is scrubbed or deleted. |
| T9 | Decide what `learning.md` becomes now that arrakis is ported | Copied to `docs/arrakis/learning.md` so nothing was lost, but the hard rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still names `~/Github/arrakis` as its home, and that path is about to be archived. Either the rule's path changes to this repo, or the log is declared closed. Not decided, so nothing in the global rules was edited. |

### 4. Around the project

| ID | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| T10 | Start posting on Twitter | Regular updates, not an announcement. The `daily-content` skill already drafts these. |
| T11 | Build a culture around solving problems to get things done | The actual goal the rest of this serves. No plan yet. It is a writing and community problem, not a code one, so it will not be solved by shipping features. |

---

# Part 2. arrakis, the machine

Merged from `docs/arrakis/TODO.md` on 2026-11-09. Numbers are never reused.

### Where arrakis stands

The original plan had twelve phases. Progress against it:

| Phase | Work | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Network: Wi-Fi, bridge, NAT | **done** - NAT, because Wi-Fi cannot be bridged (Q5) |
| 2 | Hypervisor | **done** - libvirt and QEMU, not Proxmox (D8) |
| 3 | VMs: mentat, windtrap, sietch | **done** - all three running, autostart on |
| 4 | k3s | **done** - 3 nodes Ready, v1.37.2 (A12) |
| 4b | gVisor | **dropped** - adds 15-50% to every system call (plan.md section 0) |
| 5 | Argo CD | **done** - v3.5.7, NodePort 30080, Tailscale on mentat |
| 5b | Sealed Secrets | not started - **A18** |
| 6 | Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis | **done** - both on windtrap, persistence proven |
| 7 | Observability | not started - **A20** |
| 8 | Applications and public access | not started - no image to deploy yet |
| 9 | CI: GitHub Actions, Docker, Trivy | not started - **A21** |
| 10 | NetworkPolicies and RBAC | not started - **A22** |
| 11 | Extras: Redpanda, OpenBao | OpenBao **done** on `shieldwall`. Redpanda **rejected on measured numbers** - D53 |
| 12 | Chaos practice | not started, and correctly last |

**The next real step is the GitOps loop itself (A23):** Argo CD is installed but
manages nothing. Until a commit to Git changes the cluster, nothing above is
connected.

---

### Open work on arrakis


### A23. Close the GitOps loop

**Status:** open. **This is the next step.** Nothing else is blocked by it, but
nothing is connected without it.

Argo CD is running and manages **zero** applications. Its entire purpose is:
watch a Git repository, make the cluster match it. That link does not exist yet.

**The stale manifests are gone.** They were ported into this repository on
2026-11-09 and removed the same day. They described a
service named `hono-engine` on port 3000, from an earlier version of the
project, pointing at the placeholder `github.com/example/quarantine.git` and an
image `hono-engine:latest` that was never built.

Pointing Argo CD at those would have given `ImagePullBackOff` and five suspects
at once: the repo URL, the sync policy, the image name, the registry, or the
manifest. Nothing is lost by their removal — there was no payload.

**What changed under this item.** The engine is now decided (see T4 and
`apps/engine/README.md`): C++ only, `isolate` for the sandbox, and a **systemd
unit on the host, not a pod**, because a sandbox inside a container must nest
namespaces and isolate's man page says containers are "not recommended".

So this item no longer ends in a deployed engine. It ends in a proven loop with
*something else* as the payload. Decide what the cluster is still for before
writing a new manifest — that question is now open and was not open before.

**So prove the pipeline before the payload.** Deploy something known-good that
needs no build - a plain upstream image - commit it, and watch Argo CD apply it
without being told.

```
step 1   git commit -> Argo CD syncs -> pod running     proves the LOOP
step 2   swap in the real engine                        proves the APP
```

**Done means:** a commit pushed to GitHub appears in the cluster with no
`kubectl apply`, and `argocd app get` shows `Synced` and `Healthy`. The payload
is deliberately not the engine.

---

### ~~A13. Learn StatefulSets and PersistentVolumes~~

**DONE 2026-11-08.** Proven by destroying the pod and finding the data intact.
See learning.md Q53. The four `local-path` traps are recorded there: data pinned
to one node, `reclaimPolicy: Delete`, no volume expansion, and
`WaitForFirstConsumer`.

---

### A24. Store the PostgreSQL password in OpenBao and have the pod read it

**Status:** open. **This is the next step.**

Right now the password is generated by OpenTofu and lives in two places:

```
a Kubernetes Secret   data/postgres-credentials
OpenTofu state        tofu/k8s/terraform.tfstate   (gitignored)
```

OpenBao holds nothing. It was built before anything needed it.

The real shape is: the password lives in OpenBao, and the pod fetches it at
startup by proving its own identity - no password copied anywhere.

**What that needs:**

1. A kv-v2 secret in OpenBao holding the credentials. `secret/` is already
   mounted and proven (Q52).
2. **Kubernetes auth** enabled in OpenBao, so a pod can authenticate with its
   ServiceAccount token instead of a password.
3. A delivery mechanism. Two options, both unread:
   - **External Secrets Operator** - syncs an OpenBao secret into a Kubernetes
     Secret. Simple; the secret still exists in the cluster.
   - **Vault Agent Injector** - mounts the secret into the pod as a file. No
     Kubernetes Secret at all. More moving parts, and it is a HashiCorp component
     whose OpenBao support must be checked.

**Read before building:** OpenBao's Kubernetes auth documentation, and whichever
delivery option is chosen. Neither has been read.

**A circularity to think about first.** OpenBao is on `shieldwall`, outside the
cluster, deliberately (D41). It seals on every reboot and must be unsealed by
hand. **So if arrakis reboots, pods that fetch their secrets from OpenBao cannot
start until a human unseals it.** That is the cost of the design and it should be
a conscious choice, not a surprise at 3am.

**Done means:** the PostgreSQL password originates in OpenBao, and the
OpenTofu-generated one is gone.

---

### ~~A13 (old heading)~~

**Status:** open. Created by decision D28, and needed before PostgreSQL runs.

Choosing option B means the database runs as a pod, which needs two concepts the
project has not touched yet.

- **PersistentVolume** - disk that outlives a pod. Without it, restarting the
  database pod loses the data.
- **StatefulSet** - a workload type that gives each pod a stable name and its own
  disk. A plain Deployment gives neither.

Read before starting:
`kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/` and
`kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/`.

Two documented warnings to remember:

> "Deleting and/or scaling a StatefulSet down will not delete the volumes
> associated with the StatefulSet."

> "When using Rolling Updates with the default Pod Management Policy
> (OrderedReady), it's possible to get into a broken state that requires manual
> intervention to repair."

The official tutorial deploys NGINX, not a database, and advises practising "in a
cluster that doesn't run any real workloads".

For PostgreSQL specifically, **CloudNativePG** is the mainstream operator: a CNCF
Landscape project, 9561 stars, v1.30.1 (2026-09-23). Its docs site returned an
empty page to a plain fetch; read the repository instead.

**Done means:** a StatefulSet with a PersistentVolume runs and survives a pod
delete, measured and written into learning.md.

---

---

### ~~A19. Deploy PostgreSQL and Redis as pods~~

**DONE 2026-11-08.** Both running on `windtrap`, both proven by deleting the pod
and finding the data intact.

```
postgres-0   postgres:17.6-trixie   5Gi   postgres-0.postgres.data.svc.cluster.local:5432
redis-0      redis:8.10.3-trixie    1Gi   redis-0.redis.data.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

**One trap recorded for later:** Redis is configured
`maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`. Eviction can discard **stream** entries, which
for a job queue means silently dropping jobs. **If this Redis becomes the real
queue, change it to `noeviction`** so writes fail loudly. See learning.md Q56.

---

### ~~A19 (old)~~

**Status:** closed.

Redis needs about 50 MB and, unlike PostgreSQL, loses nothing important if it
restarts empty - it is a cache and a queue. So it may not need persistent
storage at all, which makes it much simpler: a Deployment rather than a
StatefulSet.

**Decide first:** does this Redis hold anything that must survive a restart?
The original plan used Redis Streams as the job queue, and a queue that loses
jobs on restart is a different thing from one that does not.

Decision D28 chose option B, so both run as pods, and decision D32 puts both on
the cluster rather than on dedicated machines. Redis needs about 50 MB;
PostgreSQL about 300 MB.

The storage comes from `local-storage`, kept deliberately in decision D30, which
runs as the `local-path-provisioner` pod.

For PostgreSQL the mainstream route is **CloudNativePG** - a CNCF Landscape
project, 9561 stars, v1.30.1. Its documentation site returned an empty page to a
plain fetch; read the repository instead.

**Done means:** both reachable from inside the cluster by DNS name, and the data
survives deleting the pod - proven by deleting it.

---

### A18. Sealed Secrets

**Status:** open. Needed before any real credential goes into Git.

GitOps means the cluster matches Git. A database password cannot go into Git in
plain text. Sealed Secrets encrypts a secret so that **only this cluster** can
decrypt it, which makes the encrypted form safe to commit.

Chosen over OpenBao in the original plan because OpenBao costs RAM. HashiCorp
Vault changed to a non-open-source licence (BSL) in 2023; OpenBao is the fork.

**Done means:** a secret committed to Git in encrypted form, decrypted by the
cluster, and used by a pod.

---

### ~~A20. Observability~~

**DONE 2026-11-08.** VictoriaMetrics v1.154.1 + Grafana 13.2.5, as pods on
`sietch`. Verified end to end: 7 scrape targets all `up`, `count(up)` = 7, real
cAdvisor data returned.

```
Grafana      http://mentat:30300           (over Tailscale, no tunnel)
VM in-cluster http://victoria-metrics.observability.svc.cluster.local:8428
admin password secret/grafana-admin in namespace observability
```

**What it found immediately:** Argo CD uses **772 MiB** - more than ten times
PostgreSQL and Redis together (62 MiB) - while managing zero applications. See
learning.md Q61.

**Note:** `server-plan.md` budgeted 350 MB for the databases. The real figure is
62 MiB. Its estimates are not reliable; measure instead.

---

### A25. Decide what to do about Argo CD's 772 MiB

**Status:** open. Created by the measurement in A20.

Argo CD is the largest consumer in the cluster and currently manages nothing.
Seven pods: server, repo-server, application-controller, redis, dex-server,
notifications-controller, applicationset-controller.

**At least three of those are probably unnecessary here:**

| Component | Purpose | Needed? |
|---|---|---|
| `dex-server` | Single sign-on against an external identity provider | **No** - local admin login is used |
| `notifications-controller` | Sends alerts to Slack, email and so on | **No** - nothing configured |
| `applicationset-controller` | Generates many Applications from a template | **No** - not even one Application exists |

`server-plan.md` already anticipated this: "ArgoCD, with dex and notifications
off".

**Read first:** the Argo CD documentation on disabling optional components.
Scaling a Deployment to zero replicas is the crude way; there may be a supported
one.

**Done means:** a measured before-and-after figure in learning.md, and nothing
broken.

---

### ~~A20 (old)~~

Two conflicting designs exist and **neither is decided**:

- `quarantine/server-plan.md` wanted ClickHouse plus an OpenTelemetry Collector
  plus Grafana, reusing ClickHouse because it is already being studied.
- The later plan wanted VictoriaMetrics plus VictoriaLogs plus Grafana.

`server-plan.md` is no longer authoritative (D33), so this needs a fresh
decision, with the measured RAM figures rather than its estimates.

**Note:** `metrics-server` is already running and gives `kubectl top`. That is
instant resource use, not history. Neither stores anything.

**Done means:** a decision recorded with a reason, then one metrics store
running, with its measured cost.

---

### A21. CI: build images, scan them

**Status:** open. Needs an application first.

GitHub Actions builds the image, **Trivy** scans it for known vulnerabilities in
its libraries before it deploys, and the image goes to a registry the cluster can
pull from.

Trivy runs in CI, not on arrakis, so it costs the server nothing.

**An unanswered question:** where does the image live? The cluster is on a
private network, so it cannot pull from a registry needing credentials without
setup. Options: GitHub Container Registry with a pull secret, or import images
directly into k3s with `k3s ctr images import`.

**Done means:** a push to the repository produces a scanned image that the
cluster can pull.

---

### A22. NetworkPolicies and RBAC

**Status:** open. Comes after the applications exist.

- **NetworkPolicy** - rules for which pods may talk to which pods. The target:
  judge pods can reach **nothing**, so untrusted code cannot reach the database.
- **RBAC** - rules for which person or program may perform which action.

**Everyday comparison:** NetworkPolicies are the walls and locked doors between
rooms; RBAC is what each employee's badge opens.

**A gap to check first:** k3s's default network plugin is Flannel, which
**does not enforce NetworkPolicy**. Confirm before relying on it. Calico or
Cilium would be needed, and both cost RAM - Cilium about 400 MB.

Argo CD already installed NetworkPolicies for its own namespace, visible in the
install output.

**Done means:** a pod that provably cannot reach the database, tested by trying.

---

### A16. Verify Argo CD local users and RBAC before sharing access

**Status:** open. Needed before giving anyone else access. Decision D37.

The claim that Argo CD local users plus RBAC can produce a **read-only** account
is from the shape of the product, **not yet verified against its
documentation**.

Read and quote:
- `argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/`
- `argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/`

Answer: can a local user be created without SSO, what does a read-only policy
look like exactly, and can the `admin` account be disabled afterwards?

**Done means:** a second account exists that can view applications and cannot
change the cluster, proven by trying a forbidden action.

---

---

### ~~A17. Watch arrakis memory during the nightly ClickHouse build~~

**MOOT 2026-11-08.** There is no nightly build any more (D42). The memory
pressure it was watching for is real but now comes from the cluster, not a
build. That concern lives in **A9**.

---

### ~~A17 (old heading)~~

**Status:** open. Blocker AB10.

arrakis is at **3438 MB available** after k3s and Argo CD. The build timer fires
at midnight and the build wants 2 to 4 GB.

It should fit, but the margin is thin and swap may start being used.

```bash
# after the next midnight build
ssh arrakis 'free -m; cat /proc/swaps; vmstat 1 5'
```

`si` and `so` in `vmstat` are swap-in and swap-out pages per second. Non-zero
means the machine is actually paging, not just holding swap in reserve.

**If it does swap:** this is the moment TODO A9 (zram and KSM) stops being
optional. That changes decision D26, which parked it on the grounds that RAM was
not the binding limit.

**Done means:** a measurement taken during a build, written here with the date.

---

---

### ~~A1. ccache misses 99.66 percent of the time~~

**MOOT 2026-11-08.** The build, the ccache and the ClickHouse source were all
deleted (D42). No build means no cache and no problem.

**Nothing was learned about WHY ccache was broken.** The leading suspect was that
`ch-master-build` recreated the worktree, changing the absolute path and so every
cache key. If a ClickHouse build ever returns, this returns with it, and the
diagnosis in learning.md A1 history still applies.

---

### ~~A1 (old heading)~~

**Status:** open. Deferred by decision on 2026-11-08, to be fixed later.
**Cost of leaving it:** every midnight build recompiles ~46000 files from
scratch. Hours of CPU and SSD wear, every night, for nothing.

Measured 2026-11-08:

```
Cacheable calls   46430
Hits                158   ( 0.34 %)
Misses            46272   (99.66 %)
Cache size        5.4 GB of 100 GB
Cleanups           3216        <- should not happen in an almost-empty cache
```

Only `max_size` is configured. Everything else is default, and four defaults are
wrong for this build.

| Setting | Current | Suspected problem |
|---|---|---|
| `compiler_check` | `mtime` | Any clang package update invalidates the whole cache |
| `base_dir` | empty | Absolute paths enter the cache key unchanged |
| `hash_dir` | `true` | The build directory path enters the key |
| `sloppiness` | empty | One `__DATE__` or `__TIME__` in a header means a miss every build |

**Prime suspect:** the build runs in `~/Github/worktrees/latest-build/build_master`.
If `~/.local/bin/ch-master-build` deletes and recreates that worktree, the
absolute path changes every night and **no cache key can ever match**.

**First step when picked up** — read the build script, do not guess:

```bash
ssh arrakis 'cat ~/.local/bin/ch-master-build'
```

**Then** find which reason causes the misses, one change at a time:

```bash
ssh arrakis 'ccache -s -v | grep -iE "miss|hit|invalid|unsupported|preprocess"'
```

**Done means:** the hit rate on a second build of the same commit is above
90 percent, measured and written here with the date.

**Do not** change four settings at once. You will not learn which one mattered.

---

---

### ~~A5. Convert `mentat` to OpenTofu, by import~~

**DONE 2026-11-08.** All four VMs are now in OpenTofu state, and
`tofu plan` reports **"No changes"**.

Done with an `import` block plus `-generate-config-out`, **not** a hand-written
config. The hand-written attempt produced a plan that said "updated in-place,
0 to destroy" - whose actual content was the removal of the guest-agent channel,
the clock timers, the audio device and the memory balloon from a running control
plane. See learning.md Q62.

**`tofu/mentat.tf` is 1255 lines and most of it is `null`. Do not tidy it.**
Every `null` states that an attribute is unset. Deleting a line schedules a
device for removal.

---

### A26. Investigate why `cp` is shadowed on the PC

**Status:** open. Small, but a core command doing something unexpected is a trap.

While backing up OpenTofu state, `cp src dst` produced:

```
clang++: error: no such file or directory: '/tmp/.../tfstate-before-mentat-import.json'
```

Something in the zsh configuration aliases or shadows `cp` so it reaches
`clang++`. It silently did not copy the file.

```bash
type -a cp; alias | grep -w cp; which -a cp
```

**Done means:** the cause is identified and either removed or written down in
the dotfiles repository.

---

### ~~A5 (old heading)~~

**Status:** open. Low urgency, real value.

`mentat` is the only VM built by hand, so it is the only one that can drift from
the repository. It already did: `autostart` was never set, and it stayed off
after a reboot while the pool and network returned (learning.md Q22).

**Use `tofu import`, never re-create.** Re-creating destroys the disk.

```bash
# read the live definition first
ssh arrakis 'virsh --connect qemu:///system dumpxml mentat' > libvirt/domains/mentat.xml
```

Write a `mentat.tf` that matches that XML exactly, then import it, then run
`tofu plan` and expect **"No changes"**. Any difference means the file does not
yet describe reality.

**Done means:** `tofu plan` reports no changes for `mentat`.

---

---

### A8. Factor windtrap.tf and sietch.tf into one resource set

**Status:** open. Tidiness, not function.

The two files are near-identical. The clean form is one set of resources with
`for_each` over a map of VMs.

**The trap:** `for_each` changes each resource's address from
`libvirt_domain.windtrap` to `libvirt_domain.vm["windtrap"]`. OpenTofu would read
that as "destroy the old, create the new" and **delete two working VMs**.

**The correct method is `tofu state mv`**, which renames a resource inside the
state file without touching the real machine:

```bash
tofu state mv 'libvirt_domain.windtrap' 'libvirt_domain.vm["windtrap"]'
```

Do every resource (volume, seed volume, cloudinit disk, domain) for both VMs,
then `tofu plan` and expect **"No changes"**. Anything else means stop and
restore the state backup.

**Done means:** one file describes all OpenTofu VMs, and `tofu plan` reports no
changes.

---

---

### A14. Find out what `helm-install-gateway-api-crd` is

**Status:** open. Small, but unexplained things become surprises later.

A pod named `helm-install-gateway-api-crd-n977m` ran on first boot and reached
`Completed`. It installs Gateway API custom resource definitions.

It is **not** in the list of packaged components on
`docs.k3s.io/installation/packaged-components`, which names only `coredns`,
`traefik`, `local-storage`, `metrics-server` and `servicelb`.

Questions to answer: is it new in v1.37, can it be disabled, and does it cost
anything at rest?

**Done means:** an answer in learning.md with the page or release note it came
from.

---

---

### A9. zram and KSM — NO LONGER OPTIONAL

**Status:** open. **Promoted 2026-11-08 by decision D54.**

D26 parked this because RAM was not the binding limit. **It now is.**

```
2026-11-08, before the cluster   three VMs held 2628 MB of 11690
2026-11-08, now                  8704 MB allocated to four VMs
                                 2298 MB free on arrakis
```

Redpanda was rejected purely on memory (D53). The next thing wanted will hit the
same wall.

**KSM should do unusually well here:** all four VMs run the same Debian 13 from
the same base image, so much of their memory is byte-identical. zram compresses
pages and keeps them in RAM, costing CPU - and the four cores are now idle since
the ClickHouse build was removed.

**Measure before and after, and write both numbers down with the date.** Decision D26: do it to learn it and to absorb spikes, **not**
to run more VMs.

**Why not for more VMs.** Measured 2026-11-08 with three VMs running:

```
RAM   allocated 7168 MB, actually held 2628 MB, 8466 MB available
CPU   4 real cores, all four taken by the ClickHouse build every midnight
```

RAM is not the binding limit. CPU is. Swap buys memory; it never buys a core.

**The three parts, in order of value:**

| Part | What it does | Expected gain |
|---|---|---|
| zram | Compresses pages and keeps them in RAM. No disk. | 1 to 2 GiB effective |
| KSM | Shares identical memory pages between the three VMs | hundreds of MB |
| SSD swap | Already enabled, 11 GiB. Prevents crashes. | slow: ~1000x RAM latency |

KSM should do unusually well here, because all three VMs run the same Debian 13
from the same base image, so much of their memory is byte-identical.

**Measure before and after. Write both numbers down with the date.**

```bash
# baseline
free -m; cat /sys/kernel/mm/ksm/pages_sharing 2>/dev/null; zramctl 2>/dev/null

# zram
sudo apt install -y systemd-zram-generator
sudo tee /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf <<'EOF'
[zram0]
zram-size = ram / 4
compression-algorithm = zstd

**Verify the command names and paths against the installed version before
running any of this.** The package name and unit name differ between Debian
releases, and the above is written from pattern, not yet from the docs on this
machine.

**Done means:** a before and after table in learning.md, with the date, plus a
note on whether the gain was worth the CPU cost.

### Closed, kept for the numbers

| # | Item | Date | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|
| A4 | Decide Proxmox or not | 2026-11-08 | D8: libvirt on the existing kernel. KVM was already in it. |
| A6 | Build `sietch` | 2026-11-08 | Running, 10.10.10.13, booted first time. |
| A7 | Stale DHCP hostname `db` | 2026-11-08 | Fixed live with `net-update --live --config`; no VM disconnected. |
| A10 | Does `windtrap` join the cluster? | 2026-11-08 | D28: yes, option B. |
| A11 | Read the outstanding k3s pages | 2026-11-08 | Q34, Q35. SQLite default confirmed; iptables bug does not apply. |
| A12 | Install k3s | 2026-11-08 | 3 nodes `Ready`, v1.37.2+k3s1. |
| A15 | Decide Argo CD access | 2026-11-08 | D38: NodePort 30080 plus Tailscale on mentat. Nothing public. |
| A2 | Loopback hostname `127.0.1.1` | 2026-11-08 | **Moot.** It was a Proxmox requirement only; D8 dropped Proxmox. Worth tidying one day. |
| A3 | Tailscale vs Proxmox DNS conflict | 2026-11-08 | **Moot.** Same reason as A2. libvirt does not manage host DNS. |
| AB1 | Lid close suspended the machine | 2026-11-08 | `busctl` returns `s "ignore"`. |
| AB5 | Proxmox decision | 2026-11-08 | Closed by D8. |
| AB6 | Stale pacman catalogue | 2026-11-08 | `omarchy-update` ran; OpenTofu v1.13.1. |
| AB8 | nvram directory | 2026-11-08 | Exists, `drwxr-xr-x libvirt-qemu`. |
| AB9 | mentat headroom after k3s | 2026-11-08 | Measured: k3s 865 MB, Argo CD 356 MB, 1463 MB still free. |
| - | `mentat` built by hand | 2026-11-08 | Running, autostart, 10.10.10.11. |
| - | `windtrap` built by OpenTofu | 2026-11-08 | Running, autostart, 10.10.10.12. |
| - | Argo CD installed | 2026-11-08 | v3.5.7, 7 pods Running, HTTP 200. |

### arrakis blockers

| # | Blocker | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| ~~AB4~~ | ~~ccache hit rate 0.34 percent~~ | **MOOT.** The build and the cache were deleted (D42). |
| AB7 | arrakis runs its battery flat when unplugged | D6 removed the suspend safety net. It died once already. **Keep it on mains.** |
| ~~AB10~~ | ~~arrakis down to 3438 MB available; the midnight build wants 2-4 GB~~ | **Restated as AB11.** There is no midnight build any more. |
| AB11 | **RAM is the binding limit.** 8704 MB allocated to four VMs on an 11690 MB host. | Redpanda was rejected purely on memory (D53). The next thing wanted will hit the same wall. A9 and A25 are the two levers. |

## Open questions

- **T12 is the only urgent item in this file.** A committed password does not
  expire on its own and archiving does not hide it.
- T3's wording, as above. It is the only item here that cannot be started.
- T9: move the learning log here, or close it. Blocks nothing, but the global
  agent rule points at a path that is going away.
- T4: adopt or build. This decision gates T5, T7 and most of the timeline.
- T2: whether sponsorship arrives before or after there is an audience to
  sponsor. Doing it in the wrong order costs credibility that is hard to buy
  back.
